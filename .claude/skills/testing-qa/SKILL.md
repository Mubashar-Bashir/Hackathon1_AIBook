# Testing & Quality Assurance Skill

This skill provides comprehensive testing and quality assurance expertise for the AIBook project. The focus is on ensuring high-quality, reliable, and accessible educational experiences through systematic testing approaches.

## Expertise Area

Specialized in:
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies
- Performance and accessibility testing
- Test-driven development (TDD) approaches
- Quality metrics and monitoring
- Security and compliance validation

## When to Use This Skill

- When creating or reviewing test strategies
- When implementing quality assurance processes
- When validating accessibility compliance
- When optimizing performance
- When ensuring security and compliance requirements

## Capabilities

- Design comprehensive test strategies
- Implement unit and integration tests
- Perform accessibility and performance testing
- Validate security requirements
- Monitor quality metrics

## Approach

1. Identify appropriate testing strategies for the feature
2. Create test plans covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
3. Implement accessibility and performance validation
4. Establish quality metrics and monitoring
5. Ensure security and compliance validation

## Output Requirements

- Comprehensive test coverage (minimum 80% for critical components)
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Security validation and compliance checks
- Quality metrics and reporting

## Examples

When asked to test a new educational feature, this skill would:
- Create unit tests for individual components
- Design integration tests for system interactions
- Validate accessibility compliance with WCAG standards
- Test performance under expected load conditions
- Verify security and data protection measures

## Red/Green/Refactor Phase Guidance

### Red Phase (TDD - Test-Driven Development)
- Create failing tests that define the expected behavior
- Write tests that clearly express the requirements
- Focus on one functionality at a time
- Ensure tests are specific and deterministic

### Green Phase (Implementation)
- Write minimal code to make tests pass
- Focus on functionality rather than optimization
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Verify all tests pass before refactoring

### Refactor Phase (Improvement)
- Improve code structure without changing behavior
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
- Apply design patterns where appropriate
- Ensure all tests continue to pass after refactoring

## Security Validation

When performing security validation, this skill will:
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Check authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Verify secure communication protocols
- Test for proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
