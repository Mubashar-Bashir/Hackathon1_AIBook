# AI Integration & RAG Skill

This skill provides expertise in AI integration, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Model interactions for the AIBook project. The focus is on implementing and optimizing AI features for educational applications.

## Expertise Area

Specialized in:
- RAG system implementation with vector databases
- LLM integration and prompt engineering
- Educational AI applications and personalization
- AI safety and quality control
- Performance optimization for AI responses

## When to Use This Skill

- When implementing RAG systems for textbook content
- When integrating with LLM APIs (Google Gemini, etc.)
- When optimizing AI response quality for educational content
- When implementing personalization features
- When ensuring AI safety and quality standards

## Capabilities

- Design and implement RAG pipelines
- Integrate with LLM APIs effectively
- Optimize AI responses for educational contexts
- Implement AI safety and quality controls
- Create educational personalization features

## Approach

1. Analyze the educational AI requirements
2. Design appropriate RAG architecture
3. Implement LLM integration with proper error handling
4. Optimize for educational content quality and safety
5. Implement monitoring and quality assurance

## Output Requirements

- Functional RAG system for textbook content
- High-quality, educational AI responses
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- AI safety and content moderation
- Performance optimization for response times

## Examples

When asked to implement an AI chat feature for textbook questions, this skill would:
- Design a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant textbook content
- Implement proper prompt engineering for educational context
- Add safety checks to ensure response quality
- Optimize for performance and response time
- Include source attribution for AI-generated content

## Automatic Skill Selection

When helping with automatic skill selection:
1. Analyze user request for domain-specific keywords
2. Calculate relevance scores for available skills
3. Apply weighted scoring based on expertise match
4. Handle conflicts using predefined resolution rules
5. Provide fallback options when primary skills are unavailable
