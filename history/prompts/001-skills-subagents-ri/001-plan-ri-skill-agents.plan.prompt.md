# Plan RI Skill Agents

## Prompt Text
```
plan RI-Skill-agents
```

## Response Text
```
Created comprehensive implementation plan for specialized skills and subagents to support the Red/Green/Refactor/Implementation phases of the AIBook project. The plan includes:

- Technical Context with Python 3.11, TypeScript/JavaScript, Claude Code framework, and performance goals
- Complete Constitution Check showing alignment with all project principles
- Detailed project structure for skills in .claude/skills/ and subagents in .claude/agents/
- Research document outlining architecture decisions and implementation patterns
- Data model for skills, subagents, invocations, and selection criteria
- Quickstart guide for using the specialized skills and subagents
- API contract for skill and subagent invocation interfaces
- Agent context updated with new technologies from the plan
```

## Outcome
Successfully completed Phase 1 planning for the specialized skills and subagents implementation. All required artifacts have been created including the implementation plan, research, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts. The agent context has been updated with the new technology stack information. The plan aligns with all constitution principles and is ready for task breakdown in the next phase.
