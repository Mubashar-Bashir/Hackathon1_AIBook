## 2. Coordinate Systems and Transformations

### Homogeneous Transformation Matrices (HTM)

Homogeneous Transformation Matrices (HTMs) are powerful tools used to represent both the rotation and translation between two coordinate frames in a single matrix. A 4x4 HTM, denoted as `**T**`, combines a 3x3 rotation matrix `**R**` and a 3x1 translation vector `**p**`:

$$
T =
\begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\
0^\top & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:
- `**R**` is the 3x3 rotation matrix, describing the orientation of the new frame relative to the old frame.
- `**p**` is the 3x1 position vector, describing the origin of the new frame relative to the old frame.
- `0^\top` is a 1x3 zero vector (transpose of a zero column vector).

HTMs allow us to transform points or vectors from one coordinate system to another. If we have a point P_A in frame A and want to find its representation P_B in frame B, where frame B is known relative to frame A by T_{BA}, we use:

$$
P_B = T_{BA} P_A
$$
