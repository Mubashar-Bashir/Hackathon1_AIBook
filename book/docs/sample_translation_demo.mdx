# Translation Feature Demo

This page demonstrates how the translation component is integrated into the textbook.

## Sample Textbook Content

This is a sample section of textbook content that can be translated. The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook covers advanced topics in artificial intelligence and robotics, including perception, planning, control, and human-robot interaction.

  chapterId="translation-demo"
  onContentChange={(newContent) => {/* This would update the content in a real implementation */}}
/>

### More Content

Here's another paragraph that could benefit from translation. Advanced robotics systems require sophisticated algorithms for motion planning, obstacle avoidance, and task execution in dynamic environments.

## How It Works

The translation component is designed to work seamlessly with the Docusaurus documentation system. When a user toggles the translation button:

1. The component sends the content to the backend translation API
2. The backend uses Gemini AI to translate the content to Urdu
3. The translated content replaces the original content
4. Users can toggle back to the original content at any time

## Authentication Required

Note that translation features require the user to be logged in to access the AI translation services.
