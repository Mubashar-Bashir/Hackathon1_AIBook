# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome
This textbook serves as a comprehensive guide to the exciting and rapidly evolving fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts, it covers foundational concepts, advanced theories, and practical applications.

## Course Overview

This course is divided into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Focus: Middleware for robot control.
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Focus: Advanced perception and training.
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.
- Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions
- Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand the architecture of modern humanoid robots
- Be able to design and implement robotic control systems using ROS 2
- Create realistic simulations of robotic systems
- Apply AI techniques to robotic perception and control
- Integrate LLMs with robotic systems for natural language interaction
